### 1.2 Reflection  
In the career counselling session, I was tasked with identifying the specific skills, knowledge, and experiences necessary for advancing in my career path. This process started with a self-evaluation, during which I compiled a comprehensive list of criteria matching the role and career I aim to achieve. By comparing these requirements with my existing skills, I discovered a significant gap especially in fields such as advanced technical certifications, experience in project leadership, and involvement with cross-functional teams. I also learned how to tailor my CV to align with the needs of specific companies, ensuring that it reflects the language and focus of their job descriptions. In addition, we were taught how to create effective, personalized cover letters that clearly communicate our strengths and alignment with the position being applied for. This understanding made me recognize that although I have a strong foundation, focused growth is important to close the gap between my current position and my professional aspirations. 

To address these gaps, I brainstormed practical and achievable action steps. I dedicated myself to obtaining industry recognized certifications, signing up for online courses, and pursuing guidance from seasoned experts and having a mentor. Additionally, I intend to offer my help for stretch assignments at my job and work together on interdepartmental initiatives to acquire practical experience. With the new knowledge of tailoring application documents, I will now approach job applications with greater strategy and confidence adapting my CV and cover letters to reflect the values and needs of each potential employer. Reflecting on this process has helped me tie together self-awareness, career goals, and strategic personal development. It has empowered me to take charge of my career growth with a clear roadmap and the tools needed to navigate opportunities more effectively.

### 2.2 Reflection
During our career counselling session on skills and interests, I had the chance to really think about what matters to me and how it connects to the kind of work I want to do. As someone studying communication networks and growing more interested in cloud computing, it was helpful to step back and look at the bigger picture. I realized that values like continuous learning, innovation, and working well with others are really important to me and they’re also key in tech careers like cloud and network engineering. I also discovered that I’m genuinely interested in things like designing efficient networks, securing online communication, and exploring tools like AWS and Azure.

As we worked through the session, I was able to spot some strong transferable skills I’ve picked up, like problem solving, teamwork, and being able to think critically under pressure. On the technical side, I recognized how my hands on skills like configuring networks, managing IP addresses, and setting up cloud based systems are already helping me build a solid foundation. Thinking back on achievements like leading a successful group project on network simulation or completing labs in Linux and network security made me feel more confident in what I’ve accomplished so far. Overall, this session helped me connect the dots between who I am, what I’m good at, and where I want to go next in my career.

## 3. Personal assessment
### 3.1 Evidence

### 3.2 Reflection
During the personality assessment session in career counselling, I explored how both internal traits and external influences shape my career choices. I reflected on outside influences such as my parents encouragement, conversations with friends already in the IT field, and the inspiration I’ve drawn from tech-focused shows and online content. I then learned how personality profiling can help me understand my natural strengths like analytical thinking, curiosity, and calmness under pressure as well as areas to improve, such as speaking more confidently in high stakes situations. This understanding has given me tools to better connect with others and explain my value in interviews, especially by framing my strengths using clear, professional language. 

I evaluated my personality across several areas: I gain energy through focused, independent work, I absorb information by looking at both technical details and broader system impacts, I make decisions logically but consider user experience, and I prefer having a plan but can adapt quickly when things change skills that match well with roles in network and cloud engineering. Learning about the six personality types and seeing how mine fits into structured, solution-oriented careers helped reinforce my interest in becoming a cloud specialist or network engineer. It also gave me more confidence to pursue opportunities that align with who I am and how I naturally operate in technical and team settings.

### 4.2 Reflection
During the session on creating a CV, I gained valuable insight into what makes a professional and impactful job application. I began by understanding the essential components of a well-structured CV, including personal information, employment history, education, references, and job relevant skills. We also explored how each section should be tailored to highlight the most relevant information for a specific job vacancy. One of the most eye opening parts of the session was learning how to style a CV effectively keeping it clean, easy to read, and aligned with the industry I am applying to. I also learned the importance of editing my CV carefully, making sure it is not only free from errors but also focused and targeted to each application. 

In addition to the CV, we were shown how to write a strong, well-structured cover letter that complements the CV by telling our personal story, showcasing our passion for the role, and explaining why we are a great fit for the company. By the end of the session, I felt much more confident in presenting myself professionally on paper, and I now understand how to use my CV and cover letter together to stand out in competitive job markets especially for roles in IT, networking, and cloud-related fields.

## 5.2 Reflection
After submitting my CV, I had the opportunity to reflect on the entire process and the feedback I received. It became clear how important it is to present a clear, concise, and tailored document that reflects both my technical background and my career interests in networking and cloud computing. One of my main goals was to ensure that the CV spoke directly to the job roles I’m targeting, using the right language and showcasing the most relevant skills. I made a focused effort to highlight my education, certifications, and practical experience such as lab work and group projects involving network configuration and virtual environments. 

I also improved the structure and formatting to make the document more readable and professional. Through the feedback and revision process, I learned how even small changes like rewording job duties or adjusting the layout can make a big impact on how my CV is perceived. As a result, I now feel more confident that my CV presents a strong first impression and truly reflects the kind of candidate I am.
